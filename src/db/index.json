    "conclusion":"The patient is an adult female 55 years old. She had a motor vehicle while crossing an intersection with bilateral pulmonary contusions, kidney contusions, perforated bowel and a left open humerus fracture.  The patient was transferred to the operating room for an emergent exploratory laparotomy and repair for her fractures then to surgical ICU.  She is on a ventilator with no spontaneous respiration present. Complete radiological and laboratory investigation was done. All prescribed medication was taken. Nursing care for this patient included suctioning the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal airways wound dressing, central venous pressure monitoring, cannulation, intravenous therapy and catheterization.",
